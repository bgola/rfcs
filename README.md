# SuperCollider RFCs

The RFC (Request for Comment) system allows SuperCollider contributors to discuss large-scale decisions in project direction in a focused environment.

## Proposing an RFC

Great RFCs are strong and decisive with clear and direct writing. They do a great job at explaining and justifying their motivations and showing the reader what the problems are.

To help you write great RFCs, we have a template structure for you to fill out. This skeleton helps you write a coherent and persuasive proposal:

- **Motivation.** Introduce and set the background for your proposal. Some example points of discussion:
  - What specific problems are you facing right now that you're trying to address?
  - Are there any previous discussions? Link to them.
- **Specification.** Describe the new thing you're implementing. The more concrete and technical it is, the better.
- **Downsides, risks, and challenges.** Carefully consider every possible objection and issue with your proposal.
- **Remaining work.** Are there any portions of your proposal which need to be discussed with the community before the RfC can proceed? Be careful here -- an RFC with a lot of remaining work is likely to be stalled. If your RFC is mostly "Remaining Work," it may not be ready.

## Discussing an RFC


If you are discussing an RFC, it is your responsibility to work towards **reaching a conclusion**. When you make a post to the RFC thread, talk about the contents of the RFC, and the RFC alone.

- Do you agree with the proposal in its current form? Does it adequately address any concerns or objections you have?
- Do you have suggestions for how the RFC can be revised or expanded, especially in the Remaining Work section? (Be careful though -- avoid scope creep.)

### Don't be shy

Even if you aren't an active SC contributor, or if you don't feel "qualified" to discuss the topic, you can and should directly state your opinion on an RFC that affects you in some way.

Even a brief message like

> I agree with this. X has caused a lot of problems for me and this would be great.

is extremely helpful.

People who disagree with a proposal are more likely to speak up. To counterbalance this, a lot of people simply posting "I agree" will give a good impression of the amount of support in the community.

### No Wafflin' Around

There is a very real danger when an RFC discussion plays out, and that danger is derailment and off-topic discussion. Imagine spending a lot of time and effort making a proposal, then finally showing it to the list. Nobody seems to show interest in helping to advance the proposal. How would you feel?

The SC community is an enthusiastic one that loves talking about cool ideas. Unfortunately, tangential discussion often dilutes the thread and makes it hard to actually gauge what the consensus is. **Starting or continuing tangents is disrespectful to the RFC author and is strongly discouraged.**

Showing up to a thread with some tangential musings, in place of any actual opinion stated on the original RFC, is known as Wafflin' Around. **Wafflin' Around is punishable by death.**
