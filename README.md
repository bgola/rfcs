# SuperCollider RFC

The RFC (Request for Comment) system allows SuperCollider contributors to discuss large-scale decisions in project direction in a focused environment.

## Proposing an RFC

Great RFCs are strong and decisive with clear and direct writing. They do a great job at explaining and justifying their motivations and showing the reader what the problems are.

To help you write great RFCs, we have a template structure for you to fill out. This skeleton helps you write a coherent and persuasive proposal:

- **Motivation.** Introduce and set the background for your proposal. Some example points of discussion:
  - What specific problems are you facing right now that you're trying to address?
  - Are there any previous discussions? Link to them.
- **Specification.** Describe the new thing you're implementing. The more concrete and technical it is, the better.
- **Downsides, risks, and challenges.** Carefully consider every possible objection and issue with your proposal.
- **Remaining work.** Are there any portions of your proposal which need to be discussed with the community before the RfC can proceed? Be careful here -- an RFC with a lot of remaining work is likely to be stalled. If your RFC is mostly "Remaining Work," it may not be ready.

## Discussing an RFC

There is a very real danger when an RFC discussion plays out, and that danger is derailment and off-topic discussion. Imagine spending a lot of time and effort making a proposal, then finally showing it to the list. But then someone makes an offhand comment, and the majority of the thread is musings about a tangential topic. Nobody seems to show interest in helping to advance the proposal. How would you feel?

If you are discussing an RFC, it is your responsibility to work towards **reaching a conclusion**. When you make a post to the RFC thread, talk about the contents of the RFC, and the RFC alone. Just by answering these questions, you've already done a lot:

- Do you agree with the proposal in its current form? Does it adequately address any concerns or objections you have?
- If you are neutral on the proposal -- which points in favor and against the RFC strike you as particularly strong?
- Do you have opinions and ideas on the remaining work in the RFC?

Tangential discussion is strongly discouraged. **Starting or continuing tangents is disrespectful to the RFC author.** Starting tangents without expressing your actual opinion on the original proposal is known as Wafflin' Around. **Wafflin' Around is punishable by death.**
